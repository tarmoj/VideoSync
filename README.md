# Video Sync Player

... to play video files in sync in several browsers. 

Developed for video scores of [Gudmundur Steinn Gunnarson](https://gudmundursteinn.net/). Naturally it can be used for  any other video files supported by the browser but playing video scores is the intended application.

Place the index.php to the same folder with the video files on your web server (PHP 8 required). The file list on the page will be filled automitacally.

Open the page. On one of the devices select the "Host mode", on others "Join the session". Scan the QR code of the host and all play/pause/stop/seek changes will be synced.

The devices must be in one network with internet access.
